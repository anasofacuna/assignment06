			</div>
			<div class="col-md-8">
				<p>Rugby is a contact team sport that originated in England, and is now popular all over the world. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts at either end. The games consist of two 40 minute halves with a ten minute halftime in between.</p>

				<h4 class="text-left">Objective</h4>

				<p class="text-left">The objective of rugby is the same as in American Football: to advance the ball into the opposing end zone, called the try zone. Similarly, a team advances the ball by running it up the field and the opposition attempts to stop the advance by tackling the player with the ball. Passing the ball forward is not allowed in rugby. A forward pass, or even a ball dropped forward, results in a turnover. Much of the game of rugby is aimed at passing the ball backwards until a player has open space to advance the ball and place it in the try zone either untouched, or in a one-on-one situation so that player can break the tackle and score.</p>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h4 class="text-center">Positions</h4>

				<p class="text-left">Forwards: The forwards are generally responsible for gaining possession of the ball, through scrums, rucks, and lineouts. Forward plays are more rapid and shorter in distance, and players generally use combined strength to overpower the other team and send the ball to the back line.</p>

				<p class="text-right">Backs: These players tend to be faster, and aim to run the ball down the field while navigating the other team. Backs must have good passing and catching skills, because their plays are wider and need to be precise so that possession is not lost.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h4 class="text-right">Important Terms</h4>
				<p class="text-right">Scrum: Players bind together, and try to drive the other team off the ball.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Ruck: Once the player is tackled to the ground, the ball is fair game. The teams compete for the ball by trying to drive the opposition away from the ball.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Lineout: When the ball travels out of bounds, the teams line up side by side, and two players lift a third who tries to catch the ball.</p>
				<p class="text-right">Try: Scored by touching the ball down in the oppositionâ€™s try zone. Worth 5 points, plus an additional 2 if the ball is kicked through the uprights.</p>

		<div class="col-md-10">
			<p class="text-right pinfo">Another common version of rugby is played with only seven players on each team. The lineup consists of three forwards and four backs, and the games are only 14 minutes long. Since there is much more open space on the field, rucks are kept minimal, so that players can spread out as much as possible. With to fewer players, game has a greater focus on strategic plays, longer runs, and faster pace. Because the games are shorter, it is common to have a sevens tournament, where each team would play four or five times within the same day.</p>
